What if you could build intelligent applications that harness the power of large language models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to deliver responsive, context-aware features? With Azure Container Apps, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure Cosmos DB this is possible. Imagine your app, deployed on Azure Container Apps, making real-time calls to Azure OpenAI for generating and interpreting data. At the same time, Azure AI Search integrates relevant information directly into responses, adding a powerful retrieval layer. This is ideal for large language model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications that require up-to-date, contextually relevant information. Additionally, when the large language model needs to interpret code, it can make live calls to Azure Container Apps sessions for code execution. And with fine-tuning and inferencing on Azure Container Appsâ€™ GPU instances, even the most intensive AI-driven scenarios are efficiently supported. This setup delivers managed, scalable AI capabilities across your app, designed to meet real-world demands within a unified Azure ecosystem.

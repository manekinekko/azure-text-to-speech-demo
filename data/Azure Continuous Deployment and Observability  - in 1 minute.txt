In a fast-paced CI/CD pipeline, continuous deployment is essential—but only if you can trust your deployment process. Azure Container Apps offers built-in continuous deployment capabilities via integrations with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines. Every code change triggers a new revision, deployed without downtime. And with full observability through Azure Monitor, Log Streaming, and the Container Console, you get real-time insights into your app’s performance. Whether you’re tracking CPU usage or debugging a live issue, observability is fully integrated, letting you monitor, diagnose, and act—without ever pausing your app.

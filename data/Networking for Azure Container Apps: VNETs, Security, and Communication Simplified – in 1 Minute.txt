As your microservices grow, managing how they connect can get tricky. With Azure Container Apps, networking features are built-in, including full support for custom Virtual Networks (V NETs) that give you control over communication between services. V NETs allow you to keep certain connections private, making it easy to secure your applications and isolate services as needed. When you need public access, Azure makes it easy to set upâ€”offering automatic, free certificates, the option to use custom domain names, and fine-tuned control over which traffic gets through and where it goes. And for app-to-app communication within your Azure Container Apps environment, service discoverability is seamless, allowing your applications to find and connect with each other effortlessly. This way, whether scaling public-facing APIs or secure internal microservices, Azure Container Apps lets you customize, secure, and control all network traffic at every level.
